This vignette explains the basics of using the `oceglider` package. Please note
that the package is still a work in progress, with functions evolving as the
authors realize that new features might be helpful to analysts working with
glider data.

The package started with code to read SeaExplorer data in what is called "raw"
form.  Functions are provided to work with both data telemetered back to base
as the glider is en-route, and with data downloaded after it is recovered.
These functions are named `read.glider.seaexplorer.delayed()` and
`read.glider.seaexplorer.realtime(),` respectively.

In addition to functions for reading such data, some specialized variants of
standard R functions, notably `plot()`, `summary()` and `[[`, were set up.
These differ from similar functions in the `oce` package both in the sorts of
plots that are offered and in handling the internal structure of the objects
used in the `oceglider` package (e.g. with the separation of payload and glider
files, for the SeaExplorer devices).

The next stage in the evolution of the package was to handle Slocum data. The
functions `read.glider.slocum()` and `read.glider.slocum.netcdf()` were
designed for this work, but neither has been tested recently, because the
data servers being employed recently seem to store a more generic format that
is handled by `read.glider.netcdf()`.

Indeed, as of September 2024, it seems that many datasets are provided in a
format that `read.glider.netcdf()` can read.  A problem that is still
unresolved, here and generally for oceanographic data, is the naming convention
for variables (and units). Work is underway, both in the `oceglider` package
and the older and more general `oce` package, to handle the variety of names in
a more accurate manner, and in a way that lets users intercede when they know
the convention being used in a particular dataset.

The `oceglider `code uses datasets from Reference 1 extensively for testing and
illustration. The data format in these files is assumed to reflect up-to-date
standards with respect to formatting and nomenclature.

Other vignettes explain how to deal with data acquired with SeaExplorer and
Slocum gliders. These are the best place to start, in learning how to
use `oceglider`.
