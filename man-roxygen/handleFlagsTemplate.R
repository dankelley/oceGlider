#' @description Data-quality flags are stored in the \code{metadata}
#' slot of \code{\link{oce-class}} objects in a
#' \code{\link{list}} named \code{flags}.
#' The present function (a generic that has specialized versions
#' for various data classes) provides a way to
#' manipulate the core data based on
#' the data-quality flags. For example, a common operation is to replace suspicious
#' or erroneous data with \code{NA}.
#'
#' If \code{metadata$flags} in the object supplied as the first argument
#' is empty, then that object is returned, unaltered.
#' Otherwise, \code{handleFlags} analyses the data-quality flags within
#' the object, in relation to the \code{flags} argument, and interprets
#' the \code{action} argument to select an action to be applied to matched
#' data.
#'
#' @param flags A \code{\link{list}} specifying flag values upon which
#' actions will be taken. This can take two forms. In the first, the
#' list has named elements each containing a vector of integers. For example,
#' salinities flagged with values of 1 or 3 through 9 would be specified
#' by \code{flags=list(salinity=c(1,3:9))}. Several data items can be specified,
#' e.g. \code{flags=list(salinity=c(1,3:9), temperature=c(1,3:9))} indicates
#' that the actions are to take place for both salinity and temperature.
#' In the second form, \code{flags} is a list with unnamed vectors, and
#' this means to apply the actions to all the data entries; thus,
#' \code{flags=list(c(1,3:9))} means to apply not just to salinity and temperature,
#' but also to everything else that is in the \code{data} slot. If \code{flags}
#' is not provided, then \code{\link{defaultFlags}} is called, to try to
#' determine a conservative default.
#'
#' @param actions An optional \code{\link{list}} that contains items with
#' names that match those in the \code{flags} argument.  If \code{actions}
#' is not supplied, the default will be to set all values identified by
#' \code{flags} to \code{NA}; this can also be specified by
#' specifying \code{actions=list("NA")}. It is also possible to specify
#' functions that calculate replacement values. These are provided
#' with \code{object} as the single argument, and must return a
#' replacement for the data item in question.
#' See \dQuote{Details} for the default that is used if \code{actions} is not supplied.
#'
#' @param debug An optional integer specifying the degree of debugging, with
#' value 0 meaning to skip debugging and 1 or higher meaning to print some
#' information about the arguments and the data. It is usually a good idea to set
#' this to 1 for initial work with a dataset, to see which flags are being
#' handled for each data item. If not supplied, this defaults to the value of
#' \code{\link{getOption}("oceDebug")}.
