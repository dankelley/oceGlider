The `qc*.R` files contain a series of versions of a QC (quality-control) app,
designed to work with SeaExplorer data.

The app is in rapid development, as of the late summer of 2019. The author
works with a version named `qcbeta.R`, but others ought to work with the
highest-numbered version, which on Aug 8th is `qc07.R`.
