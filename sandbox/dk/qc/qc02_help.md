**Loading data**

1. Use the pulldown menus in the leftmost column to select a glider and
   mission.  This menu is constructed from examination of the directory
`/data/glider/delayedData`, so that's the place to put the data.

2. Once a glider/mission pair is selected, you have two choices:
    * You may click the button labelled `Read` to read the raw data from the
appropriate subdirectory of `/data/glider/delayedData`.
    * You may use the pulldown menu that is in the second-from-left column,
if that menu displays a date and time. This lets you resume a previous
analysis.  (These previous analyses are stored in `.rda` files in the present
directory, when you press the button labelled `Save`.)
