\title{Convert SBE Oxygen Frequency Value to Oxygen Saturation}
\usage{
swOxygenFrequencyToSaturation(
  temperature,
  salinity,
  pressure,
  frequency,
  cal,
  unit = "ml/l"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{temperature}{numeric value holding temperature in degrees C.}

\item{salinity}{numeric value holding Practical Salinity.}

\item{pressure}{numeric value holding pressure in dbar.}

\item{frequency}{the frequency reading from the oxygen sensor
system, in Hz.}

\item{cal}{list or data frame holding calibration parameters named
\code{Soc}, \code{Foffset}, \code{A}, \code{B}, \code{C}, \code{D} and \code{Enom}.  The last of these
is called "E nominal" in the calibration sheets.}

\item{unit}{character value indicating the desired unit. The
default is \code{ml/l} but \code{umol/kg} is also accepted, the latter being
computed by multiplying the former by \code{44.6591*1000/(1000+sigma0)},
where \code{sigma0} is seawater potential density anomaly in kg/m^3
(see Reference 1, which uses the mole fraction stated in Reference 2).}

\description{
The calibration formula comes from SBE calibration sheets. This
code is based on \code{sbeO2Hz2Sat()} in
\url{https://github.com/DFOglider/pilotingApp}, with minor
modifications: (1) it has a new name to avoid conflicts, (2) the
calibration coefficients are collected into a single parameter,
\code{cal}, (3) \code{oxygenFrequency} is renamed \code{frequency}, (3) \code{unit}
is added, to permit specifying the unit of the return value,
and (5) the conversion to umol/kg takes into account the density,
as indicated in Reference 1.
