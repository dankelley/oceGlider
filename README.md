`oceglider` is an R package for processing ocean glider data, with support
for Slocum and SeaExplorer devices.

Since `oceglider` is not on CRAN, it must be installed from source. An easy way
to do that is to use the `remotes` package to install it from the github source,
by executing

    remotes::install_github("dankelley/oceglider", ref="develop")

in an R console.
